        <h1>Talk about yourself</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Francis Agbo, a passionate software developer and lifelong learner. I'm currently pursuing my studies
          at AltSchool, where I'm diving deep into modern web technologies and software engineering principles. I love
          creating innovative solutions and turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly applications. When I'm
          not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing
          knowledge with fellow developers.</p>
